        <h2> Happiness Index Project</h2>
        <p> Utilized R, Excel, & Tableau to independently conduct a full data science & econometric research project through: Gathering Data & Creating Datasets, Cleaning Datasets, Conducting Exploratory Data Analysis, Creating a variety of models and tests, then visualizing the data and writing a 20 page research paper.
<br><br>
This project focused on how the World Happiness Index was related to a variety of variables, which I narrowed down to seven in the project. I utilized SLR, MLR, log transforms, A-B testing, and F-Tests in the project. E-mail me at mab1096unh@gmail.com for the full paper!</p>

        <h2> Economic Research Capstone: Education & Economic Growth</h2>
        <p> 
    <div class = "description"> This project focused on how education is related to poverty and economic growth. There were two parts of this project I did, the first where I worked with a group to research the problem and do the economic theory and literature review areas, and the second where I worked independently to conduct the full data science process. We each recognized our strengths and worked together cohesively to complete the project and at the UNH Paul College Undergraduate Research Conference.
      <br> <br>
In this project I utilized R, Excel, & Tableau to gather data, create datasets, clean the data, conduct exploratory data analysis, create models and tests, then visualize and present the results in a clear understandable way to the judges at the PCBE Undergraduate Research Conference.
       <br> <br>
I wrote the Data, Methods, & Results section of the paper, Created Visualizations, Merged the data into one dataset and did the full econometric process independently.
       <br> <br>
The types of models created were: SLR’s, MLR’s, Log-Transforms & Log. Regressions, and tested the data.

     Created models on how Income is related to Education & Work Experience.
