    <div class = "projecttitle"> Economic Research Capstone: Education & Economic Growth: </div>
    <div class = "description"> This project focused on how education is related to poverty and economic growth. There were two parts of this project I did, the first where I worked with a group to research the problem and do the economic theory and literature review areas, and the second where I worked independently to conduct the full data science process. We each recognized our strengths and worked together cohesively to complete the project and present at the UNH Paul College Undergraduate Research Conference, as one of the only groups to conduct a full data science project in our class.
In this project I utilized R, Excel, & Tableau to gather data, create datasets, clean the data, conduct exploratory data analysis, create models and tests, then visualize and present the results in a clear understandable way to the judges at the PCBE Undergraduate Research Conference.
I wrote the Data, Methods, & Results section of the paper, Created Visualizations, Merged the data into one dataset and did the full data science process independently.
The types of models created were: SLR’s, MLR’s, Log-Transforms & Log. Regressions, and tested the data.

Then added the 9 occupation groups to the model because different occupations get paid different incomes along with different requirements of levels of education and experience. After this, I conducted more data analysis and created different restricted and unrestricted models to conduct 2 f-tests on each primary model and then created visualizations.
