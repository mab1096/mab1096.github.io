    <div class = "description"> Independently conducted a full Data Science & Econometric research project for my Econometrics class. Utilized R, Excel, & Tableau to conduct a full data science & econometric research project through: Gathering Data & Creating Datasets, Cleaning Datasets, Conducting Exploratory Data Analysis, Creating a variety of models and tests, then visualizing the data and writing a 20 page research paper.
Project was on how the World Happiness Index was related to a variety of variables, which I narrowed down to seven in the project. I utilized SLR, MLR, log transforms, A-B testing, and F-Tests in the project. E-mail me at mab1096unh@gmail.com for the full paper! </div>

    <div class = "projecttitle"> Economic Research Capstone: Education & Economic Growth: </div>
    <div class = "description"> This project focused on how education is related to poverty and economic growth from my Economics Research Capstone class, where I worked with a group to research this problem and do the economic theory and literature review areas but worked independently to conduct the full data science process. We each recognized our strengths and worked together cohesively to complete the project and present at the UNH Paul College Undergraduate Research Conference, as one of the only groups to conduct a full data science project in our class.
In this project I utilized R, Excel, & Tableau to gather data, create datasets, clean the data, conduct exploratory data analysis, create models and tests, then visualize and present the results in a clear understandable way to the judges at the PCBE Undergraduate Research Conference.
I did the Data, Methods, & Results section of the paper, Created Visualizations, Merged the data into one dataset and did the full data science process independently.
The types of models created were: SLR’s, MLR’s, Log-Transforms & Log. Regressions, and tested the data.

    <div class = "projecttitle"> Logistics Power B.I. </div>
    <div class = "description"> Utilized Power B.I., Power Query/Pivot, and Excel to organize, automate, and create responsive visualizations that get updated as new data comes in. This project was from my Advanced Excel Data Analytics class, and the logistic project is based on common situations that data and business analysts encounter when analyzing data, and effective ways to solve these problems through creating responsive datasets that update from databases, responsive data paths and configurations, and responsive visualizations. </div>

    <div class = "description"> The Insurance project was another final project for my Predictive Modeling class, where I utilized R, Excel, and Tableau to make log transforms so data fit a normal distribution because the data would work in this format without overfitting or confounding the data and then using the insurance data to conduct Logistic Regression and utilizing a test and training model to predict insurance outcomes and insurance rates based on the given data. </div>
